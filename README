QmidiCtl - A MIDI Remote Controller via UDP/IP Multicast
--------------------------------------------------------

QmidiCtl is a MIDI remote controller application that sends MIDI data
over the network, using UDP/IP multicast. Inspired by multimidicast [3]
and designed to be compatible with ipMIDI for Windows [4].

QmidiCt [1] has been primarily designed for the Maemo [5] enabled
handheld devices, namely the Nokia N900 [6] and also being promoted
to the Maemo Package [7] repositories. Nevertheless, QmidiCtl [1]
may still be found effective as a regular desktop and, ultimately,
as an Android application as well [8].

Requirements
------------

The software requirements for build and runtime are listed as follows:

  Mandatory:

  [1] Qt framework, C++ class library and tools for
        cross-platform application and UI development
        https://qt.io/


Installation
------------

The installation procedure follows the standard for source distributions.
Unpack the tarball and in the extracted source directory:

    ./configure [--prefix=/usr/local]
    make

and optionally as root:

    make install

This procedure will end installing the following couple of files:

    ${prefix}/bin/qmidictl
    ${prefix}/share/applications/hildon/qmidictl.desktop
    ${prefix}/share/icons/hicolor/32x32/hildon/qmidictl.png

Just launch ${prefix}/bin/qmidictl and you're off (hopefully).

Note that the default installation path ${prefix} is /usr/local.

If you're checking out from Git, you'll have to prepare the
configure script just before you proceed with the above instructions:

   ./autogen.sh


Configuration
-------------

QmidiCtl holds its settings and configuration state per user, in a file
located as $HOME/.config/rncbc.org/QmidiCtl.conf . Normally, there's no
need to edit this file, as it is recreated and rewritten everytime
qmidictl is run.


Bugs
----

Probably plenty still, QjackCtl maybe considered on beta stage already.


Support
-------

QmidiCtl is open source free software. For bug reports, feature requests,
discussion forums, mailling lists, or any other matter related to the
development of this piece of software, please use the Sourceforge
project page (https://sourceforge.net/projects/qmidictl).
