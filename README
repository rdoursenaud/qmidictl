QmidiCtl - A MIDI Remote Controller via UDP/IP Multicast
--------------------------------------------------------

QmidiCtl is a MIDI remote controller application that sends MIDI data
over the network, using UDP/IP multicast. Inspired by multimidicast
(http://llg.cubic.org/tools) and designed to be compatible with ipMIDI
for Windows (http://nerds.de).

Requirements
------------

The software requirements for build and runtime are listed as follows:

  Mandatory:

  [1] Qt4 (core, gui), C++ class library and tools for
        crossplatform development and internationalization
        http://qt.nokia.com/products/


Installation
------------

The installation procedure follows the standard for source distributions.
Unpack the tarball and in the extracted source directory:

    ./configure [--prefix=/usr/local]
    make

and optionally as root:

    make install

This procedure will end installing the following couple of files:

    ${prefix}/bin/qmidictl
    ${prefix}/share/pixmaps/qmidictl.png
    ${prefix}/share/applications/qmidictl.desktop

Just launch ${prefix}/bin/qmidictl and you're off (hopefully).

Note that the default installation path ${prefix} is /usr/local.


Configuration
-------------

QmidiCtl holds its settings and configuration state per user, in a file
located as $HOME/.config/rncbc.org/QmidiCtl.conf . Normally, there's no
need to edit this file, as it is recreated and rewritten everytime
qmidictl is run.


Bugs
----

Plenty still, after all this is alpha software ;)


Support
-------

QmidiCtl is open source free software. For bug reports, feature requests,
discussion forums, mailling lists, or any other matter related to the
development of this piece of software, please use the Sourceforge
project page (http://sourceforge.net/projects/qmidictl).

You can also find timely and closer contact information on my personal
web site (http://www.rncbc.org).
